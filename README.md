Setup Instructions for Python Hands-on Workshop

1)	Download and install the Python 2.7 version of Anaconda available here:
https://www.continuum.io/downloads
2)	Open the “Anaconda Navigator” program
3)	Click on the “Environments” tab
4)	Click “Create” and enter a name for your environment “Py2.7_Geosciences” for example
5)	In the right-hand panel change “installed” to “Not installed” in the drop down
6)	Use the “search packages” window to search for and install the following packages: Numpy, NetCDF4, Scipy, Matplotlib, basemap
7)	Select the named package from the list of matching modules and click “apply”

Now you have an environment that should be able to run the exercise. Next we need to launch the Jupyter notebook to display and run the code.

8)	Click on the “home” tab
9)	Select “Py2.7_Geosciences” from the “applications on” drop-down 
10)	Click “install” on the jupyter notebook cell
11)	Launch the jupyter notebook – it should open a new tab on your browser

Finally we need to download and test the code.

12)	Open this link in your browser: https://github.com/pjirvine/Petes_Princeton_Python_Plots
13)	Click “clone or download” and select download zip (or clone it using Git if you want)
14)	Unzip the zip file in the “AnacondaProjects” folder that Anaconda created on your machine (or in some other accessible location).
15)	Browse to this folder in the Jupyter tab on your browser.
16)	Select the “plot_notebook.ipynb”
17)	Click on the first cell and then press the >| button to execute the code.
18)	If nothing happens except the [*] at the top left of the cell turns into a [1] then everything is fine. If not check that all the modules have been installed correctly in your environment and that you’ve run jupyter on the correct environment.
19)	STOP

The code works and you’ll be able to run the exercise yourself during the hands-on session. Note – I’ll finalize the course material by Friday 25th evening so what’s currently there will change.

If you’d like to get an introduction to Python I’d recommend running through the interactive course available for free on codeacademy: https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python

For a more advanced introduction to Python for Geosciences I’d recommend this course: https://github.com/koldunovn/python_for_geosciences
